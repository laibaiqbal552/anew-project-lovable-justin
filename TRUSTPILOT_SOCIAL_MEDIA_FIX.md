# Trustpilot & Social Media Integration Fix

## Overview
Fixed Trustpilot reviews not displaying and implemented social media followers scraping with ScrapAPI. Enhanced the Dashboard to show only social media followers and display Trustpilot reviews in the detailed data tab.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Trustpilot Reviews Not Showing ✅
**Problem:** Trustpilot reviews were not displaying on the Dashboard Trustpilot card

**Root Cause:**
- The fetch-trustpilot-reviews edge function had issues with URL construction and data parsing
- The comprehensive-brand-analysis function was calling it but getting null responses

**Solution:** Improved the fetch-trustpilot-reviews edge function with:
- Multiple URL fallback strategies (domain-based + business name slug)
- Better error handling and logging
- Flexible field extraction for rating and review counts
- Support for multiple field naming conventions (rating, score, reviewCount, totalReviews, etc.)
- Increased timeout and retry logic
- More robust review parsing

**File Modified:** `supabase/functions/fetch-trustpilot-reviews/index.ts`

### 2. Social Media Followers Scraping ✅
**Problem:** No way to get actual follower counts from social media profiles

**Solution:** Created new edge function `fetch-social-media-followers/index.ts`
- Uses ScrapAPI to scrape social media profiles
- Extracts follower counts for all major platforms (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.)
- Platform-specific field extraction logic
- Parallel fetching for multiple profiles
- Graceful fallback when ScrapAPI not configured

**File Created:** `supabase/functions/fetch-social-media-followers/index.ts`

### 3. Dashboard Social Media Card ✅
**Problem:** Card showed engagement rate and active platforms instead of actual follower data

**Solution:** Updated Dashboard to show:
- Individual social media profiles with their follower counts
- Total followers summary at bottom
- Live Data badge for ScrapAPI-sourced data
- Clean list view of each platform

**File Modified:** `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (lines 1605-1649)

**Before:**
```
Total Followers: X (Live Data / AI-sourced)
Engagement Rate: X% (Live Data / AI-sourced)
Active Platforms: X (Live Data / AI-sourced)
```

**After:**
```
Facebook:     10,500
Instagram:    5,200
LinkedIn:     3,100
Twitter:      1,800
YouTube:      500

Total Followers: 21,100 [Live Data badge]
```

### 4. Detailed Data - Reputation Card ✅
**Problem:** Didn't show Trustpilot-specific data in the reputation section

**Solution:** Enhanced Reputation card to display:
- **Average Rating** - Prioritizes Trustpilot rating if available, falls back to reputation API
- **Total Reviews** - Shows Trustpilot review count with "Trustpilot" badge
- **Recent Trustpilot Reviews** - Preview of latest 2 reviews with titles and star ratings
- **Response Rate** - Shows if available from reputation API
- Color-coded badges (blue for Trustpilot, green for Live Data)

**File Modified:** `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (lines 1651-1753)

```env
SCRAPAPI_KEY=your_scrapapi_api_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your_service_role_key
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Updated Functions:**
```bash
supabase functions deploy fetch-trustpilot-reviews
supabase functions deploy fetch-social-media-followers
```

- Check that comprehensive-brand-analysis can access both functions

3. **Test:**

- Verify social media followers appear in detailed data tab

## Database Changes
None required - uses existing schema:
- `analysis_data.trustpilotReviews` field
- `analysis_data.social` field with `detected_platforms` array

## Data Flow

          → Data returned to Dashboard
            → Displayed in Trustpilot card + Reputation card
```

### Social Media Followers:
```
Social Detection
  → Website crawling finds social profiles
    → fetch-social-media-followers function
      → ScrapAPI scrapes each platform
        → Follower counts returned
          → Displayed in Social Media card
            → Summary shown in Detailed Data tab
```
