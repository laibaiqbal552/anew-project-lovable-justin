## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
User clicks "Generate Report"
           ↓
Analysis.tsx executes in parallel:
  ├─ PageSpeed Insights → Website scores
  ├─ SEMrush → SEO metrics
  ├─ Social Media Detector → Detected profiles
  └─ Comprehensive Analysis Orchestrator:
      ├─ fetch-google-reviews
      ├─ fetch-trustpilot-reviews
      ├─ analyze-competitors
      └─ fetch-social-media-metrics
           ↓
Results combined into unified analysis
           ↓
Stored in Supabase brand_reports table
           ↓
Dashboard displays all metrics in dedicated "Reviews" tab
```

### Performance
